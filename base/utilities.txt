[Armok Vision.exe:Armok Vision:The best full 3D visualiser around, Armok Vision shows off Dwarf Fortress in never before seen detail.  Includes unit sprites, terrain (including off-map), clouds, buildings, day/night cycles, and much much more.  (64bit only)]

[DF Story Maker.exe:Story Maker:Creates a filtered version of the gamelog, great for... making stories.]

[DorvenRealms.exe:Dorven Realms:Creates a Minecraft level from exported world maps (dfhack "exportlegends maps" in legends mode).]

[DwarfTherapist.exe:Dwarf Therapist:Makes managing your dwarves' jobs easy, and helps explore your fort's psychology.  Note that dfhack autolabor (arguably easier) must be disabled set jobs with Dwarf Therapist.]

[isoworld.exe:Isoworld:Makes an isometric world map from exported detailed maps.  It can also connect to DF to show a 'detailed view' of the current area, which is fantastic in Adventure Mode.]

[LegendsViewer.exe:Legends Viewer:You've always wished legends mode was this good.  Sorting, searching, hyperlinks, mapped locations...]

[PerfectWorldDF.exe:Perfect World:Advanced, precise, custom world generation tool - this is how people generate maps of real places.]

[picturefort.exe:PictureFort:Makes Quickfort blueprints from images, which can be much easier.]

[Quickfort.exe:Quickfort:Like super-powered macros, Quickfort lets you design an intricate layout once, and automatically execute it a thousand times.  The Starter Pack includes a huge library of pre-made blueprints.  WARNING:  QF intercepts the 'alt' key, and will ruin any such keybinds while running - just start it up when needed.]

[soundSense.exe:SoundSense:A Sound+Music engine for DF - it reads the gamelog, and plays appropriate sounds and seasonal music.]

[DFWV.bat:World Viewer:Another third-party legends viewer, with automatic 32/64 bit switching.  Can read extra information exported by DFHack with the "exportlegends" script.]

[DwarfMockup-1.0.3.exe:DwarfMockup:DF-like interface for the creation of Quickfort blueprints, with some nice helper features]
