PeridexisErrant's Starter Pack Manager
######################################

**This project is *not*:**

- Intended for use by anyone but me
- An actual pack
- Finished, usable, or reliable

For all that stuff, [see here](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076).

**What it does:**

- not much yet `:(`

**What I hope it will do eventually:**

Make maintaining and updating my Starter Pack easier, by...

- Reading a config file that describes the pack
- Checking versions of things on DFFD (this might be useful to you!)
- Downloading stuff from DFFD or elsewhere
- Assembling it in the correct directory structure
- Configuring all the paths etc. that can be set automatically
- Checking that manual configuration has been done correctly
- Creating a compressed output to upload
- Managing some text files (changelogs, forum post, checksum, etc)

If that sounds like a lot, it is.  I had three or four working before
though, so it's not completely impossible...
