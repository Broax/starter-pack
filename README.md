# PeridexisErrant's Starter Pack Manager

This project is NOT an actual pack, or intended for public use.
[See here](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=126076) for that.

There is *no support* for using this tool.  Do not ask questions or ask for features.
(bug reports are welcome though!)  This tool is designed to help me keep
things up to date, and maybe other pack maintainers will find it useful.

**What it does:**

- Read a config file that describes the pack
- Check the latest version released on on DFFD or Github
- Download stuff if an update or missing file is detected
- Assemble it all in the correct directory structure
- Configure all the paths etc. that can be set automatically
- Create some components at runtime; eg ASCII graphics
- Zip up the built pack, ready to upload
- Generate or manage changelogs, contents list, and forum post
